camgrab v0.1
------------

  camgrab is a simple application which will use the Video4Linux 
 API for grabbing a single image from a webcam device.

  This is useful for scripted image comparison, a simple upload of
 an image to a remote server or other tasks.


Options
-------

  As the software is designed to be simple, and straightforward, there
 are only a couple of options:

 	-device Name 
	  Use the specified device for grabbing, default is /dev/video

	-output file
	  Write the captured image to the given filename, default is "shot.jpg"

	-verbose
	  Increase status reporting.

	-version
	  Display the version string.

	-help
	  Display brief instructions.


Thanks

  This application was cobbled together with the aid of the bttv and
 came source code.
